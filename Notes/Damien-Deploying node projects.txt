Deploying node projets

In React: generally with our projects, we have a static file sitting on a server that will send what is needed to the browser. There's no logic going on.

Now in deploying API:s we need a server capable of running code, taking a request, and determining what it is and what to send back to the client.
Heaps of server services to host. For our purposes, we don't need to spend money on renting a server to host our API. 

We'll use a service called Heroku.
  it's free
  requires very little setup
  not quite a serverless solution. it's a nice middleground.


:: Prepping for deployment:
  1. server needs to know how to run our code.
  2. and where to run it, ie determine which port:  we'll have Heroku choose since it'll choose a different port each time
  3. finally, we'll need a way to tell the server secrets in our app such as connecting to a db or private api keys, etc.

nb: 
  - if it's a long time between using your API, it may have gone to sleep and will be slow because it is starting up, just keep this in mind if it feels broken.
  - there's a limit to how many hours/month your API can be running on Heroku
